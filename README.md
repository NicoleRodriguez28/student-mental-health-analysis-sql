# Does Studying Abroad Affect Mental Health?  
## Overview:
This project analyzes whether attending university in a foreign country affects the mental health of international students. The analysis is based on a dataset from a Japanese international university's 2018 student survey, which was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.  

## Why This Matters:
International students face unique mental health challenges. Understanding how stress, connectedness, and cultural adaptation evolve over time can help universities better support their well-being throughout their academic journey.
  
## Key Insights:
- International students who stayed **10 years** had the **highest depression scores**, though their acculturative stress was lower — suggesting improved cultural adaptation but persistent homesickness.
- Acculturative stress **peaked** around years 7–8, then dropped sharply.
- **Social connectedness** increased steadily after year 5, peaking at year 7.
- Students with **higher English proficiency** and **longer stays** reported lower average depression levels.
