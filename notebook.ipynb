leaving everything behind to pursue a better career opportunity. Aside from the curriculums that require so much dedication, students see themselves facing many challenges that ultimately affect their academic performance due to stress, anxiety, and depression. International students that stayed 10 years had the highest average total score on the depression test (PHQ_9) but showed a lower average score of acculturative stress when compared to shorter stays. This could indicate their adaptiveness to the cultural norms of that state but still feel homesick, leading to higher rates of depression. New students only being a year or two into international living had high average acculturative stress scores, however, this peaked with students 7-8 years into international living.  \n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2b53297e-67db-4677-8cc7-a7fbd1f435d4"},{"source":"","metadata":{"chartConfig":{"bar":{"hasRoundedCorners":true,"stacked":false},"type":"line","version":"v1","x":{"field":"stay","type":"integer","sortOrder":"ascending","aggregate":null},"y":{"field":"average_phq","type":"number"},"title":"International Students Length of Stay Vs Depression"},"customType":"visualization","dataFrameVariableName":"df_by_stay","executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":56,"lastExecutedAt":1748111002324,"lastExecutedByKernel":"b7cabe84-86a5-4f5d-b857-002dc6f0b903","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":""},"cell_type":"code","id":"7b4dd1a5-dfa9-4edb-bb29-526eaf8fdf1a","outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"table":{"schema":{"fields":[{"name":"index","type":"integer"},{"name":"stay","type":"integer"},{"name":"count_int","type":"integer"},{"name":"average_phq","type":"number"},{"name":"average_scs","type":"number"},{"name":"average_as","type":"number"}],"primaryKey":["index"],"pandas_version":"1.4.0"},"data":{"index":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8],"stay":[10,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1],"count_int":[1,1,1,3,1,14,46,39,95],"average_phq":[13,10,4,6,0,8.57,9.09,8.28,7.48],"average_scs":[32,44,48,38,34,33.93,37.13,37.08,38.11],"average_as":[50,65,45,58.67,91,87.71,78,77.67,72.8]}},"total_rows":9,"truncation_type":null},"text/plain":"   stay  count_int  average_phq  average_scs  average_as\n0    10          1        13.00        32.00       50.00\n1     8          1        10.00        44.00       65.00\n2     7          1         4.00        48.00       45.00\n3     6          3         6.00        38.00       58.67\n4     5          1         0.00        34.00       91.00\n5     4         14         8.57        33.93       87.71\n6     3         46         9.09        37.13       78.00\n7     2         39         8.28        37.08       77.67\n8     1         95         7.48        38.11       72.80","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>stay</th>\n      <th>count_int</th>\n      <th>average_phq</th>\n      <th>average_scs</th>\n      <th>average_as</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>13.00</td>\n      <td>32.00</td>\n      <td>50.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>8</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>10.00</td>\n      <td>44.00</td>\n      <td>65.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>7</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>4.00</td>\n      <td>48.00</td>\n      <td>45.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>6</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>6.00</td>\n      <td>38.00</td>\n      <td>58.67</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>0.00</td>\n      <td>34.00</td>\n      <td>91.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>14</td>\n      <td>8.57</td>\n      <td>33.93</td>\n      <td>87.71</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>6</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>46</td>\n      <td>9.09</td>\n      <td>37.13</td>\n      <td>78.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>7</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>39</td>\n      <td>8.28</td>\n      <td>37.08</td>\n      <td>77.67</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>8</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>95</td>\n      <td>7.48</td>\n      <td>38.11</td>\n      <td>72.80</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"status":"success"}},"execution_count":10}],"execution_count":10},{"source":"As seen in the line graph above, there was a slight increase in depression in the first years, however it increased exponentially after the 5th year, reaching its peak at year 10.
